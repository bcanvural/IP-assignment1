Q-A: N+1 processes are created for a command which has N number of pipes.
     E.g.   ls | wc      for this command 2 processes would be created.
     Shell must wait until all of the children of the main process are terminated.

Q-B: Shell with threads is not possible because exec() command destroys the whole process
Q-C: No. Because the child executing the cd command will be destroyed. Main process won't know about the effect of the cd command.
